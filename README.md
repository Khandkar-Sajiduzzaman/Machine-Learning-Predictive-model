##  Introduction

In the modern travel industry, insurance agencies and airlines generate large volumes of data about customer policies, claims, destinations, and transactions.  
This project uses **machine learning** to classify whether a policy belongs to an **Airlines** or a **Travel Agency**.

We implemented and compared several models:
-  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression** *(from scratch)*
- **Neural Network (Feed-Forward)**
-  **K-Means Clustering** *(unsupervised)*
-  **K-Fold Cross-Validation** *(robust evaluation)*

The goal was to explore how these algorithms handle **mixed categorical and numerical data** and how model choice affects accuracy and generalization.

##  Dataset Description

**Source:** Google Sheets  
**Target Variable:** `Agency Type` *(Binary – Airlines or Travel Agency)*

| Feature Type | Columns |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Numerical** | Duration, Net Sales, Commission (in value), Age |
| **Categorical** | Distribution Channel, Destination, Claim, Gender, Agency |

###  Preprocessing Steps:
- Dropped unnecessary columns: `Agency`, `Product Name`, `Gender` (had 45k+ nulls)
- No missing values found  
- **OneHotEncoder** → categorical features  
- **LabelEncoder** → Claim, Agency Type  
- **StandardScaler** → numerical features  
- Train-Test Split → 70% / 30%

###  Observations:
- Dataset was **imbalanced** (more *Travel Agency* samples).
- Strong correlations among `Agency`, `Agency Type`, and `Distribution Channel`.

---

##  Data Pre-processing

1. **Dropped Columns:** `Gender`, `Agency`, `Product Name`  
2. **Encoding:** Applied One-Hot and Label encoding  
3. **Scaling:** Used `StandardScaler` for normalization  
4. **Train-Test Split:** 70% training, 30% testing  

This ensured that models trained efficiently without feature dominance due to scale.

##  Model Training and Evaluation

### Logistic Regression
**Performance:**
- Accuracy: **82%**
- Precision: 70% (Airlines), 86% (Travel Agency)
- Recall: 60% (Airlines), 90% (Travel Agency)
- ROC-AUC: **0.85**

 *Served as a baseline model — struggled with imbalanced classes.*

---

###  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Best K:** 3  
**Cross-Validation Accuracy:** 98.57%

**Performance:**
- Accuracy: **98.7%**
- Precision: 98% (Airlines), 99% (Travel Agency)
- Recall: 97% (Airlines), 99% (Travel Agency)
- ROC-AUC: **0.99**

 *Best overall performer — strong balance between both classes.*

---

### 3️ Neural Network
**Performance:**
- Accuracy: **97.47%**
- Precision: 92% (Airlines), 100% (Travel Agency)
- Recall: 99% (Airlines), 97% (Travel Agency)
- ROC-AUC: **0.90**

 *Captured nonlinear patterns but required more computation time.*

---

###  K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised)
Used **PCA (2D)** projection with **K=2** to visualize natural groupings between agency types.

##  Results & Visualizations

###  Model Comparison Summary

| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Precision (Avg) | Recall (Avg) | Notes |
|:------|:---------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:------|
| Logistic Regression | 82% | 0.85 | 78% | 75% | Baseline linear model |
| KNN | **98.7%** | **0.99** | **98.5%** | **98%** | Best overall |
| Neural Network | 97.4% | 0.90 | 96% | 98% | Slightly behind KNN |

##  Conclusion

 **KNN** achieved the **best performance** with:
- Accuracy: **98.7%**
- ROC-AUC: **0.99**
- Balanced Precision & Recall

 **Neural Network** also performed strongly, capturing nonlinear dependencies effectively.  
 **Logistic Regression** was helpful as a baseline but not ideal for this mixed, imbalanced dataset.

###  Key Insights
- Distance-based models (like KNN) are powerful for scaled mixed datasets.  
- Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but need tuning.  
- Proper scaling and encoding dramatically improve model performance.

###  Future Work
- Handle class imbalance with oversampling/SMOTE.  
- Tune hyperparameters for the neural network.  
- Try ensemble models: **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, or **LightGBM**.
